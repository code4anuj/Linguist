# Linguist - Team EnQ
To develop an application to translate English-based educational resources into vernacular languages (mother-tongues) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for mass-effective learning.
In short, the program will take a text in English language and will run an algorithm that will translate it into a native language. This is done with Natural Language processing. This cannot be done by simple word to word translation because every language has its own grammar. And to make the machine understand and translate keeping the grammar into account, NLP toolkit provided many operations like, Tokenizing, Stemming, tagging parts of speech, Lemmatizing, Chunking and Chinking, named entry reorganization, etc. The final product will work for both pdfs and audio files.

This project is using NLP , python , streamlit, etc...
